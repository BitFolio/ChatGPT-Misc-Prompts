# Rate articles on a scale of 1 - 10

```
Given 10 article titles and 10 article descriptions, give a single rating of the combined strength of each title and description pair on a scale of 1-10 for how likely they are to grab the reader's attention and encourage them to click through to read the article. Then, pick the top rated title and description to generate a clickable and quotable tweet that incorporates the strongest elements of the title and description, while still remaining concise and engaging. Use attention-grabbing language, active verbs, and concise messaging to encourage clicks and shares. Make sure to include relevant hashtags and a link to the article for maximum impact.
